## Repository order

Kylie appears first, followed by `pr-N` worktrees in ascending numeric order.
Other worktrees follow in natural folder-name order, with their full paths
breaking ties. This order applies during incremental loading, refreshes, and
repository additions or removals, regardless of Git's discovery order.
Rediscovering the same repositories in a different order must not restart
their active scan.

## Complexity

The branch `cx` rating measures application code complexity. For Kylie, only
Kylie application code contributes. All CI and testing code is excluded,
including runners, checks, settings, fixtures, helpers, visual-test tools,
and CI orchestration. CI and test additions or removals must neither increase
nor offset the application rating.

CI and test scores remain visible in grey on individual files and in a separate
`CI and tests` total in the branch tooltip. Changes confined to CI and tests
show a neutral `cx 0` in expanded and collapsed worktree rows.

Classification applies to each revision's path, including renames:

- Directories named `test`, `tests`, `testing`, `spec`, `specs`, or `ci`,
  including underscore or hyphen suffixes, and `__tests__`, `__mocks__`,
  `.github`, `.gitlab`, `.circleci`, and `.buildkite`, contain excluded code.
- Test filenames include `test.*`, `tests.*`, `conftest.*`, `test_*`, `tests_*`, `spec_*`, `specs_*`,
  and names ending in `.test`, `.tests`, `.spec`, `.specs`, `_test`, `_tests`,
  `_spec`, or `_specs` before the extension, or capitalized `Test`, `Tests`,
  `TestCase`, `Spec`, or `Specs` suffixes.
- Kylie CI support paths also include `scripts/ci`, `scripts/ci.bash`,
  `scripts/ci_settings.py`, `scripts/audit_runner.py`, `scripts/quick_runner.py`,
  `scripts/quick_tests.py`, `scripts/land_checks.py`, `scripts/land_migrations.py`,
  `scripts/refresh-local-db`, `scripts/benchmark_request_timing.py`, and
  `kylie/management/commands/visual_baselines.py`.

New CI or test support paths must join these exclusions. Business code outside
these paths remains counted, including application CLI code. Directory or file
names that merely contain `ci`, `test`, or `audit` do not establish an exclusion.
Tests embedded in application files are not separated from their file's score.

Identified vendor libraries stay outside both totals. Scores compare the merge
base with the same HEAD used by the branch diff; unscored files show no score.
